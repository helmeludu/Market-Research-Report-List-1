Factors contributing to the market's expansion include the rise in disposable income, an aging population seeking long-term financial stability, and the growing demand for investment-linked insurance products. </p><p>Additionally, advancements in technology are streamlining the underwriting process, making it easier for consumers to obtain policies. The market is also witnessing a shift towards customizable plans that cater to individual needs. Overall, the Permanent Life Insurance Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.4% during the forecast period, reflecting a robust demand for products that combine protection and investment benefits.</p></p>
