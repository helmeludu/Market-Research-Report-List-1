<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Mode Optical Fiber</li><li>Multimode Optical Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical fiber market is primarily divided into two types: single-mode and multimode optical fibers. Single-mode fibers have a small core diameter, allowing only one mode of light to propagate, which results in higher data transmission speeds and longer distances, suitable for telecommunication networks. In contrast, multimode fibers have a larger core that supports multiple light modes, making them ideal for shorter distances and local area networks due to their higher bandwidth but reduced range capabilities.</p></p>
