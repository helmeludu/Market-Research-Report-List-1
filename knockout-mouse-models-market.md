<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knockout Mouse Models Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>KO</li><li>cKO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Knockout mouse models are genetically modified mice used to study gene function by inactivating specific genes. The primary market types include conventional knockout (KO) models, where a single gene is completely disrupted, and conditional knockout (cKO) models, which allow for spatial and temporal control of gene inactivation. The cKO approach enables researchers to delete genes in specific tissues or developmental stages, facilitating more precise investigations into gene role and related diseases, enhancing the understanding of complex biological processes.</p></p>
